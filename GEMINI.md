# GEMINI.md - Project Design and Architectural Overview

This document outlines the high-level design choices, architectural considerations, and key technologies planned for the console-based music player. It serves as a guide for development and future enhancements.

## 1. Project Goals and Scope

The primary goal is to develop a lightweight, efficient, and feature-rich console music player for Linux environments.

**Key Features:**
* Playback of common audio formats: MP3, Ogg Vorbis, AAC.
* Support for .m3u playlists.
* Intuitive command-line interface (CLI) for playback control (play, pause, stop, next, previous, volume).
* Display of current song information (title, artist, album, duration, progress).
* Playlist management (load, save, shuffle, repeat).
* Low resource consumption suitable for older hardware or embedded systems.

**Out of Scope (for initial release):**
* Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Advanced audio effects (equalizers, reverb).
* Streaming audio from online sources.
* Support for less common audio formats (e.g., FLAC, WAVPack).
* Tag editing capabilities.

## 2. Architectural Design

The music player will follow a modular architecture, promoting separation of concerns and ease of maintenance.

### 2.1 Core Components

* **Main Application Loop (`main.cpp`):** Handles user input, dispatches commands, and orchestrates interactions between other components.
* **Audio Playback Engine:** Responsible for decoding and playing audio data. This will likely involve a third-party audio library.
* **Playlist Manager:** Manages the list of tracks, current playback position, and playlist-related operations.
* **User Interface (CLI):** Handles input parsing and output rendering to the console.
* **Configuration Manager:** Loads and saves user preferences (e.g., default volume, last played directory).

### 2.2 Data Flow

1.  User input via CLI.
2.  Input parsed by UI component.
3.  Commands dispatched to Playlist Manager or Audio Playback Engine.
4.  Playlist Manager provides track information to Audio Playback Engine.
5.  Audio Playback Engine decodes and plays audio.
6.  Playback status and track information sent back to UI for display.

## 3. Technology Stack

* **Primary Language:** C++ (targeting C++17 or newer for modern features and improved safety).
* **Operating System:** Linux (designed for compatibility with various distributions).
* **Build System:** CMake (for cross-platform compatibility, although primarily targeting Linux, and ease of dependency management).
* **Version Control:** Git.

### 3.1 Audio Libraries (Key Decision Point)

Selecting a robust and well-supported audio library is crucial. Given the requirements for MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and AAC, and your preference for open-source, the following are strong candidates:

* **[LibAV/FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/):** A comprehensive multimedia framework.
    * **Pros:** Supports virtually all audio and video formats, highly optimized, mature, widely used.
    * **Cons:** Can be complex to integrate for audio-only purposes; licensing (LGPL/GPL) needs careful consideration, but generally fine for linking.
    * **Rationale:** Provides the broadest format support (MP3, Ogg, AAC out-of-the-box).
* **[libsndfile](http://www.mega-nerd.com/libsndfile/):** For reading/writing various sampled sound files.
    * **Pros:** Simple API, good for raw audio data.
    * **Cons:** Does *not* handle compressed formats directly (MP3, Ogg, AAC); would require separate decoders (e.g., libmpg123, libvorbis, FAAD2).
    * **Rationale:** Useful for WAV or other uncompressed formats, but not sufficient on its own.
* **[PortAudio](http://www.portaudio.com/):** For cross-platform audio I/O.
    * **Pros:** Simplifies audio output to sound devices across different OSes (ALSA, PulseAudio on Linux).
    * **Cons:** Not an audio *decoder*; works with decoded PCM data.
    * **Rationale:** Excellent choice for managing audio output to the system's sound card, abstracting ALSA/PulseAudio.

**Recommendation:**
* Use **FFmpeg/LibAV** for comprehensive audio decoding of MP3, Ogg Vorbis, and AAC. Its `avformat` and `avcodec` libraries are ideal.
* Use **PortAudio** for abstracting audio output to the Linux sound system (ALSA/PulseAudio). This separates decoding from playback.

### 3.2 M3U Playlist Parsing

* **Custom Parser:** A simple text-based parser will be implemented to handle the `.m3u` format. The format is straightforward, consisting of lines with file paths, optionally prefixed with `#EXTINF` tags.

### 3.3 CLI Interaction

* **Standard I/O:** `std::cin` and `std::cout` for basic input/output.
* **Ncurses/PDCurses (Optional, for richer UI):** While the initial scope is a basic console, `ncurses` could be considered for a more interactive full-screen TUI (Text User Interface) experience (e.g., displaying a scrolling playlist, progress bars) without resorting to a full GUI. This would be a future enhancement.

## 4. Development Workflow

* **Version Control:** Git will be used for all source code management.
* **Branching Strategy:** A simple Git Flow or GitHub Flow strategy is recommended (e.g., `main` branch for stable releases, `develop` branch for ongoing work, feature branches for new features/fixes).
* **Issue Tracking:** Basic issue tracking can be done via Git hosting platform's issues (e.g., GitHub Issues, GitLab Issues) or a simple text file (`TODO.md`).

```

## 6. Future Considerations

* **Cross-platform Support:** While primarily Linux, designing with C++ and libraries like FFmpeg/PortAudio makes future macOS or Windows ports feasible.
* **Expanded Codecs:** Easy integration of other codecs if FFmpeg isn't used or for specific needs.
* **Unit Testing:** Implement robust unit tests for core components.
* **Configuration File:** Implement an INI or YAML parser for more flexible configuration persistence, aligning with your preferred formats.
* **Metadata Parsing:** Extract ID3 tags (MP3), Vorbis comments (Ogg), and other metadata for richer display. FFmpeg can assist with this.
* **Daemon Mode:** Ability to run the player in the background.
* **Customizable Keybindings.**

### Git Version Control Setup

Given your familiarity with Git, here are the basic steps to set up your repository:

1.  **Initialize Git in your project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/console-music-player
    git init
    ```

2.  **Create the files:**
    Create the `README.md`, `GEMINI.md`, and `LICENSE.md` files with the content provided above.
    Create the initial `src/main.cpp` and `CMakeLists.txt`.

3.  **Add all initial files to the staging area:**

    ```bash
    git add .
    ```

4.  **Commit your initial project setup:**

    ```bash
    git commit -m "Initial project setup: Added README, GEMINI, LICENSE, and basic structure"
    ```

5.  **Create a `.gitignore` file:**
    This is crucial for a C++ project using CMake. Create a file named `.gitignore` in the root of your project with content similar to this:

    ```gitignore
    # Build artifacts
    build/
    *.o
    *.d
    *.so
    *.a
    *.out
    *.exe
    # CMake files
    CMakeCache.txt
    CMakeFiles/
    cmake_install.cmake
    Makefile
    CTestTestfile.cmake
    # IDE files (example for VS Code, adjust as needed)
    .vscode/
    # Operating System generated files
    .DS_Store
    Thumbs.db
    # Editor swap files
    *~
    *.swp
    ```

    Then, add and commit it:

    ```bash
    git add .gitignore
    git commit -m "Add .gitignore for build artifacts and common ignore patterns"
    ```

This comprehensive setup provides you with a strong foundation for your console music player project, aligning with your preferences for open-source, Linux, C++, and detailed documentation.
